                A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF PRODUCT DELIVERY SYSTEM <br><br>

                Product delivery systems are the various ways a product is made available to the customer. This can be done in a physical store, online, or through direct mail. 
                
                Each of these methods requires different strategies. These strategies allow you to ensure that the product is delivered as planned and meets the needs of the customer. 
                
                A physical store is a popular way to offer a product to customers. It offers convenience and accessibility. Customers can browse products and select what they want without any issues. <br><br><br>
                
                However, there are some drawbacks to this method. The cost to maintain a physical store is high, especially if it involves having multiple locations. 
                
                Another issue is that customers may not visit stores as frequently as they would like. So, it lowers the chance of making a sale or building brand awareness.
                
                Online shopping offers customers convenience and visibility. Customers can browse your offerings with just the click of a button. <br><br><br>
                
                You don’t have to drive anywhere or wait for customer service to come by after shopping at a physical location. 
                
                This means you don’t have to worry about creating space for your products in stores because everything can be done online instead. 
                
                However, this also means you have an increased risk of not receiving orders. Also, it will take time for your business site to grow. 
                
                So, you’ll need other ways to deliver your products in the meantime until it does take off.<br><br><br>
                
                THE IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCT DELIVERY SYSTEMS
                
                Delivery is extremely important because they help your business succeed. Without them, you can’t get products to customers.
